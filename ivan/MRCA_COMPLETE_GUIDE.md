## What is MRCA?

MRCA (Market Regime Classification Agent) is the **"Market Analyst"** in the PokPok trading system that determines what type of market environment we're currently in. Rather than just looking at price movements, MRCA provides **actionable market context** that drives strategy selection, risk management, and trading decisions.

### Purpose
- Classify current market conditions into specific regimes
- Provide confidence scores for regime classifications
- Enable context-aware trading decisions
- Trigger automatic strategy switching based on market changes
- Optimize risk parameters dynamically

## Market Regimes Detected

MRCA can identify 6 primary market regimes:

| Regime | Description | Trading Implications |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|
| `BULL_TREND_HIGH_VOL` | üöÄ Strong uptrend with high volatility | Momentum plays, trend following |
| `BULL_TREND_LOW_VOL` | üìà Steady uptrend with low volatility | Buy-and-hold, covered calls |
| `BEAR_TREND_HIGH_VOL` | üí• Sharp downtrend with high volatility | Put options, short strategies |
| `BEAR_TREND_LOW_VOL` | üìâ Steady downtrend with low volatility | Protective puts, cash positions |
| `RANGE_HIGH_VOL` | ‚ö° Sideways market with high volatility | Straddles, range-bound strategies |
| `RANGE_LOW_VOL` | üò¥ Sideways market with low volatility | Theta decay strategies |

## How MRCA Works

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Data Access**
   - Receives OHLCV data from DPA via `agent.team_session_state["ohlcv_data"]`
   - Typically analyzes 30-150 days of historical data
   - Uses same data format as DPA output

2. **AI Analysis** (Optional)
   - AI decides which technical indicators to use
   - Chooses optimal parameters (RSI length, SMA periods, etc.)
   - Analyzes current vs historical market patterns

3. **Technical Indicator Calculation**
   - **RSI** - Momentum oscillator (overbought/oversold)
   - **SMA/EMA** - Trend direction and strength
   - **MACD** - Trend changes and momentum shifts
   - **Bollinger Bands** - Volatility and support/resistance
   - **Volume Analysis** - Market participation levels

4. **Pattern Recognition**
   - Analyzes price patterns and trends
   - Identifies support/resistance levels
   - Measures volatility characteristics
   - Detects market structure changes

5. **Regime Classification**
   - Combines indicators using logic rules or AI reasoning
   - Assigns confidence scores (0.0 to 1.0)
   - Provides explanation for classification
   - Returns structured `MarketRegimeAnalysisResponse`

### Technical Tools Available

```python
# Core MRCA tools
calculate_rsi(agent, length=14)           # RSI calculation
calculate_sma(agent, length=20)           # Simple Moving Average
calculate_ema(agent, length=12)           # Exponential Moving Average
calculate_macd(agent, fast=12, slow=26)   # MACD indicator

add_indicators_to_dataframe(agent, configs) # Bulk indicator calculation
```

## Real Value Beyond Labeling

### ‚ùå What People Think MRCA Does
- Just slaps a label like `BEAR_TREND_LOW_VOL`
- Simple pattern matching
- Could be replaced with basic if/else logic

### ‚úÖ What MRCA Actually Provides

#### 1. üéØ Context-Aware Decision Making
The **same technical signal** means completely different things in different regimes:

| Signal | Bull Trend | Bear Trend | Range Market |
|--------|------------|------------|--------------|
| RSI Oversold (25) | ‚úÖ Strong buy signal | ‚ùå Stay away, could go lower | ‚úÖ Mean reversion play |
| Resistance Break | ‚úÖ Momentum continuation | ‚ùå Likely false breakout | ‚ö†Ô∏è Could go either way |
| Volume Spike | üö® Possible regime change | üìà Potential capitulation | ‚ö° Breakout likely |

#### 2. üìä Dynamic Risk Management
- **High-vol regimes** ‚Üí Smaller positions, wider stops (3-5%)
- **Low-vol regimes** ‚Üí Larger positions, tighter stops (1-2%)
- **High confidence** ‚Üí Aggressive positioning (2-3% risk)
- **Low confidence** ‚Üí Defensive mode (0.5-1% risk)

#### 3. üîÑ Real-Time Strategy Switching
- **Bull‚ÜíBear transition** = Switch from momentum to defensive strategies
- **Low-vol‚ÜíHigh-vol** = Immediately reduce position sizes
- **Range‚ÜíTrend** = Change from mean-reversion to trend-following

#### 4. üß† Parameter Optimization
- **Trending markets** = Longer indicator periods (RSI 21, SMA 50)
- **Ranging markets** = Shorter periods (RSI 14, SMA 20)
- **Volatile markets** = Wider stops, smaller positions
- **Stable markets** = Tighter stops, larger positions

  "analysis_type_requested": "current_snapshot",
  "assessments": [
    {

    }
  ],

### Example Classification Logic (Pure Python)

```python
def classify_regime(price, sma20, sma50, rsi, volatility):
    """Rule-based regime classification (no AI needed)"""

    # Determine trend direction
    if price > sma50 and sma20 > sma50:
        trend = "bull"
    elif price < sma50 and sma20 < sma50:
        trend = "bear"
    else:
        trend = "range"

    # Determine volatility level
    vol_level = "high" if volatility > 0.03 else "low"

    # Combine for regime classification
    if trend == "bull" and vol_level == "high":
        return "BULL_TREND_HIGH_VOL"
    elif trend == "bull" and vol_level == "low":
        return "BULL_TREND_LOW_VOL"
    elif trend == "bear" and vol_level == "high":
        return "BEAR_TREND_HIGH_VOL"
    elif trend == "bear" and vol_level == "low":
        return "BEAR_TREND_LOW_VOL"
    elif vol_level == "high":
        return "RANGE_HIGH_VOL"
    else:
        return "RANGE_LOW_VOL"
```

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Your ETH Data Analysis
**Current State:**
- Price: $4,175.90
- SMA20: $4,167.73
- SMA50: $4,177.33
- RSI: 45.3
- 30-day change: -9.21%

**MRCA Classification:** `BEAR_TREND_LOW_VOL` (60% confidence)

**Trading Implications:**
- ‚ùå **Avoid:** Momentum/breakout strategies
- ‚úÖ **Focus:** Mean-reversion plays, protective puts
- ‚öñÔ∏è **Risk:** Medium position sizes (moderate confidence)
- üîç **Signals:** RSI 45.3 = Still bearish context, not neutral
- üéØ **Expectations:** False breakouts likely, fade them

### Example 2: Strategy Switching Scenarios

#### Scenario A: Bull Market RSI Oversold
```
Market: BULL_TREND_LOW_VOL
RSI: 25 (oversold)
Action: Strong BUY signal - high probability bounce
```

#### Scenario B: Bear Market RSI Oversold
```
Market: BEAR_TREND_HIGH_VOL
RSI: 25 (oversold)
Action: AVOID - could fall much further
```

#### Scenario C: Range Market Breakout
```
Market: RANGE_HIGH_VOL
Price: Breaks above resistance
Action: Small position - could be false breakout
```

## Conclusion

MRCA transforms raw market data into actionable trading context. While AI can enhance the experience with natural language processing and dynamic adaptation, the core value lies in **context-aware decision making** that can be implemented with pure Python logic.

The regime classification is just the output - the real value is in how it changes trading behavior across different market conditions.

**Remember:** You can build a complete, profitable trading system using rule-based MRCA logic before ever needing AI services!
